### Problem Statement : Create a micro-blogging application.


We have developed a fashion microblogging application where designers can come for inspiration. It consists of four pages, one, where we get all the posts from the people we are following, the second would be the search page where we'll find the latest and trending designs and the third is our profile page with our posts, our display picture and our number of followers and following. When we tap on a post, we can see all the comments and insights shared on that design for a better community feedback and also give a like to show our support. Our design focused on the simplicity of the UI and how it would be easy for anyone using the app to get better ideas about the latest fashion trends.
